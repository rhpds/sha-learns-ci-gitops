# ODF (OpenShift Data Foundation) Patches Workload

## Overview

Applies post-install patches to OpenShift Data Foundation's CSI driver. Specifically, it patches the Ceph RBD CSI driver to add tolerations for `node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service` and `medik8s.io/remediation` taints, which are applied by the [Node Health Check / Self Node Remediation](../../infra/node-health-check-operator/README.md) operators when fencing unhealthy nodes.

This is a **platform-only** workload — no infra layer (ODF itself is assumed to be already installed on the cluster).

> For background on the layer system, bootstrap chain, and common enable/disable pattern, see [docs/enabling-workloads.md](../../docs/enabling-workloads.md).

## How to Enable

> Full explanation of the enable pattern and AgnosticV integration: [docs/enabling-workloads.md](../../docs/enabling-workloads.md).

This is a single-layer workload — only one flag needed:

| Flag | File | Default |
|------|------|---------|
| `odf.enabled` | `platform/bootstrap/values.yaml` | `false` |

The platform flag must be set in the repo — it cannot be overridden from the AgnosticV catalog.

## Variables Reference

### Platform chart — `platform/odf/values.yaml`

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ocp4_workload_openshift_virtualization_workload_tolerations` | `[]` | Not currently used in any template |
| `external_ceph` | `true` | Not currently used in any template |

Note: both values exist in `values.yaml` but are not referenced by any template. The CSI toleration patch is unconditional.

### CSI Driver patch — hardcoded values

The Job patches `Driver/openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com` with these tolerations:

| Toleration Key | Effect | Value |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| `node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service` | `NoExecute` | `nodeshutdown` |
| `medik8s.io/remediation` | `NoExecute` | `self-node-remediation` |

## Gotchas

1. **Depends on ODF being installed.** This chart does not install ODF — it only patches the existing CSI driver. If ODF/Ceph is not present, the Job will fail trying to patch `Driver/openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com`.

2. **Pairs with Node Health Check.** The tolerations this Job adds are specifically for the taints applied by the Self Node Remediation operator. Enable this workload when you also enable the [Node Health Check](../../infra/node-health-check-operator/README.md) and Self Node Remediation operators.

3. **Job uses `cluster-admin`.** Creates a ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding with `cluster-admin` in the `default` namespace. Note the typo in resource names (`csi-tolersions-job` instead of `csi-tolerations-job`).

4. **Values are unused.** The `values.yaml` defines `ocp4_workload_openshift_virtualization_workload_tolerations` and `external_ceph` but neither is referenced in the templates. The patch is always applied unconditionally.

5. **Runs at sync-wave `-4`.** This is a negative wave in the platform layer, meaning it runs before default-wave platform resources. This ensures CSI tolerations are set before VMs or other storage consumers are created.
